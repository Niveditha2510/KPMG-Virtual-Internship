# KPMG-Virtual-Internship
**I attended the Virtual Internship offered by InsideSherpa. This internship had three modules.I have attached a python notebook which contains the data ananlysis and visualization. The dataset contains four excel files-Transaction.xlsx, NewCustomerList.xlsx, CustomerAddress.xlsx and CustomerDemographic.xlsx.In the second module we were asked to do a presentation. I have uploaded my presentation.In the third module we were asked to create interactive dashboards using Tableau or Power Bi. I used Tableau to create three dashboards and I have uploaded the same. Finally after completing all the modules I received my certificate.
This internship was a wonderful learning experience and helped me gain an understanding about the domain data science.**
